PleXBMC - Use KODI (aka XBMC) to play media from Plex Media Server

NOTES
-----

This is a fork of original PleXBMC, it was forked in order to add a few features which I required from my HTPC, namely:

* Ability to filter Sections depending on their name and server on which they are

FILTERING
---------

In the PleXBMC plugin configuration window -> Advenced is a field titled 'Sections to display', there sections which
will be visible for the current profile can be provided. Some examples below (entries should be space separated, if
entry itself contains space it can be wrapped in quotes ""):

* ```"TV Shows"``` it will make section titled "TV Shows" visible for the current profile, all other sections will be hidden
* ```Movies "TV Shows"``` Movies an "TV Shows" sections will be visible for the current profile
* ```Server1:Movies Server2:*``` Section Movies from Plex Server named Server1 will be visible, as well as all sections from Server2
* ```*``` All sections from all servers will be visible
* ```*:Movies``` is equivalent to ```Movies``` and will show section titled "Movies" from all servers



This is a KODI (previously known as XBMC) addon that allows media and metadata stored in the Plex Media 
Server (PMS) to be viewed and played using the KODI interface.

INSTALLATION
------------

1. Download this zip file, placing it where is can be found by XBMC.
2. Install using "Install from zip file", which can be found in 
   Settings -right arrow-> Addons
or
   Settings -click-> Addons -> Install from Zip
   
3. Browse for the plugin zip file, select and install
4. If your PMS is installed on a seperate server, then configure the addon 
   with the IP address.

Go to Video -> Addon and you should be able to browse the PMS data structure 
and select the media you want to play

USING PLEXBMC
-------------
PleXBMC should work "out of the box" in most cases, as the default allows for automatic server discovery.
If this doesn't work, then discovery can be switched off, and a manually entered hostname or IP address can be used.

If you are watching remotely, or on a bandwidth limited network, switch on Transcoding to reduce the media quality
to one that works best for you.

MYPLEX ACCESS
-------------
In addition, PleXBMC can use your myplex account to access local and remote servers, and provide user content controls when
configured via the Plex/Web interface.  Create an admin account to manage the process and then assigned managed users
to give specific access to libraries to other users.

Sign into myplex using the "Sign in" menu or through the PleXBMC settings page.

SKINS
-----
To make KODI integrate more tightly with the PLEX sourced data - you can load up a PleXBMC modified skin, which gives
access to your libraries, media and channels from the home screen, plus a view of all "recently added" or "onDeck" (in play) media.
Currently "Amber" is the most compatible and you can find this on the KODI forums.

OPTIONS
-------

PleXBMC has a number of options to help fit in with your preferred media setup.  PleXBMC is designed to work out of the box, without 
any modifications, but sometimes you might want to tweak something. Such options include the ability to switch off Home Menu
Items, change the way media is accessed, perform media source redirect to a NAS sever, Transcode media.
